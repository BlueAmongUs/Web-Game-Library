# Web Game Library

- A custom web game library

# Purpose

- Make web games with
```html
<canvas></canvas>
```

# NOTE

- (0,0) begins in *Top Left corner*
- Size is also scaled from *Top Left corner*
- The library only supports canvas context
```js
canvas.getContext("2d")
```

# Roadmap

Turning the **Web Game Library** into **Web Game Engine**
- Extending canvas contexts usability to:
```js
canvas.getContext("webgl2")
canvas.getContext("webgpu")
```
- Adding full support for mobile, controller, vr, etc... inputs
- Adding platform creator, keybind reader, etc...
- Adding 3D
- Balancing between simplicity and complexity of game development
- Optimizing game library/engine with the power of
WebGPU, WebAssembly, Web Workers, etc...

Adding **multiplayer** support
- Reducing network latency
